# The project is under development.

# ü¶ÜBlueQuack
A classic bluetooth-controlled USB Rubber Ducky clone built with ESP32 board.

# ‚ú®Features
- Minimal Setup.
- Simply controlled by Serial Console.
- Execute payloads by just sending appropiate commands.

# üëçRecommended
- Use those ESP32 boards which has at least `4MB` flash memory.
- Use SD cards which is `FAT32` formatted and at least `4GB` and upto `16GB`.

# üì¶Requirements
- `1` NodeMCU ESP-32S V1.1 38-Pins
- `1` Micro SD Card Module (3.3V / 5V)
- `1` SD Card
- `1` Micro SD Card Reader
- `1` Micro-B USB / Type-C USB Cable with data transfer support

# üóíÔ∏èNote
-  Micro SD Card Module comes in two variants : `3.3V` and `5V`.

# ‚öôÔ∏èSetup Arduino
1. Download `Arduino IDE 2.X.X` from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) according to your Operating System.
2. Install it.
3. Go to `File` ‚Üí `Preferences` ‚Üí `Additional Boards Manager URLs`.
4. Paste the following link :
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
```
5. Click on `OK`.
6. Go to `Tools` ‚Üí `Board` ‚Üí `Board Manager`.
7. Wait for sometimes and search `esp32` by `Espressif Systems`.
8. Simply install version `2.0.15`.
   - Wait for sometime and after that it is installed.
9. Download `ESP32-BLE-Keyboard` library from [here](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard).
10. Go to `Sketch` ‚Üí `Include Library` ‚Üí `Add .ZIP Library...`.
11. Select `ESP32-BLE-Keyboard-master.zip` file from the downloaded location of PC/Laptop.
    - To verify, Go to `Sketch` ‚Üí `Include Library` and check the library name under `Contributed libraries` section.
    - If it is here, then it is successfully added.
12. Done! Arduino IDE with required boards and libraries is ready.

# ‚öôÔ∏èSetup `BlueQuack.ino`
1. Download or Clone the Repository.
2. Open the folder and then open `BlueQuack` folder and just double click on `BlueQuack.ino` file.
   - It opens in Arduino IDE.
3. Compile the code.
4. Select the correct board from the `Tools` ‚Üí `Board` ‚Üí `esp32`.
   - It is generally `NodeMCU-32S`.
5. Select the correct port number of that board.
6. Upload the code.
   - Wait for sometime to upload.
7. Done!

# üìÑPayload Files
1. Open Notepad or any other text editor.
2. Write your payload in it.
3. Put Micro SD Card in Micro SD Card Reader and plug into PC/Laptop.
4. When saving the file, select Micro SD Card.
5. Name the payload as `payload1`, `payload2` etc.
   - It is saved by default as .txt files.
